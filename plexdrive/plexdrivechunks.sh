## plexdrivechunks.sh (chmod a+x plexdrivechunks.sh)
## The function of this script is to manually delete plexdrive chunk files when you are about to run out of disk space.
## NOTE: plexdrive support max disk usage for chunks, eg --clear-chunk-max-size=100GB (but if disk get full with other none plexdrive related data this wont help )
## Add to plexdrive mount: --clear-chunk-age=730h
##          Note: This would keep all downloads for a month before deleting them ( do not use --clear-chunk-max-size so maximum space its always available)
##                Do not store temp in /dev/shm since its only 50% of ram eg not enough space to keep chunks for 30days
## To run script automatically every minute type: crontab -e and andd line bellow (without ##):
## * * * * *   /path/plexdrivechunks.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
